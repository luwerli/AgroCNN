🍊 Automatic Orange Tree Detection using YOLOv8
Overview

This project implements a full geospatial deep learning pipeline for automatic orange tree detection from high-resolution orthomosaics.

It combines computer vision, spatial data engineering, and quantitative evaluation to generate plant-level outputs suitable for Precision Agriculture workflows.

Developed as an undergraduate thesis in Cartographic and Surveying Engineering.

Problem Statement

Manual plant counting and vigor assessment in large orchards is:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Not scalable

This project addresses the problem by integrating object detection with geospatial processing to enable automated, plant-level analysis.

Solution Architecture

The pipeline is fully automated and consists of:

1. Orthomosaic Tiling

1024×1024 tiles

CRS and affine transform preservation

Overlap to mitigate edge detection loss

2. Dataset Generation (YOLO Format)

Conversion of georeferenced polygons into normalized bounding boxes

Automatic label generation

dataset.yaml creation

3. Model Training

YOLOv8n (Ultralytics)

Image size: 640

GPU-optimized configuration

4. Inference & Spatial Reconstruction

Tile-based detection

Bounding box extraction (xyxy format)

Pixel → geographic coordinate transformation

GeoJSON export of detected plants

5. Post-processing

Binary raster generation (plants = 1)

Centroid extraction

NDVI computation per detected plant

6. Performance Evaluation

• Custom IoU-based matching implementation providing:

• Precision

• Recall

• F1-score

• Mean IoU

• TP, FP, FN

Matching is performed using a greedy IoU strategy (threshold ≥ 0.5).

**Technical Highlights**

• End-to-end geospatial Deep Learning pipeline

• Raster ↔ vector conversion with CRS consistency

• Pixel-space to coordinate-space transformation

• Custom detection metrics implementation

• Modular and reproducible workflow
